│   ├── Login.java
│   └── Main.java
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── dependabot.yml
└── run.bat / run.sh (Optional: for easy execution)


Step 2: Add .gitignore
Create a .gitignore file to ignore compiled .class files:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
*.class
*.log
*.DS_Store
bin/
out/


Step 3: Add LICENSE
If you're unsure, use MIT License. Here's an example LICENSE file:

Example content:

  - package-ecosystem: "maven"
    directory: "/" 
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
(Useful if you're using Maven.)

Step 6: Initialize Git Repo
Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - BookEase Library Management System"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/bookease.git
git push -u origin master
Replace the GitHub URL with your own repo link.

Step 7: Test Locally
Before uploading, make sure it works:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac src/*.java
java -cp src Main


Step 8: Submit the GitHub Link
Once everything is pushed and tested, copy your GitHub repository link and submit it.

Would you like me to generate all these files (README.md, .gitignore, LICENSE, etc.) for download?
